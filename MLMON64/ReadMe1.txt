
MLMON64 is a machine language monitor program for the C64.
It can be used to perform low-level operations on the
contents of the computer's memory, assemble and disassemble
code, and issue disk commands.  All numerical values are
entered and displayed in hexadecimal.

The program is generally similar to, but better than, the
Monitor program found in the Plus/4.  But this program can
be installed starting at any location from page 08 to page
C8, and fits exactly into 8 pages (2K) of RAM, plus a few
bytes of zero-page memory.
