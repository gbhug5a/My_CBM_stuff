
SSP4 is Charles Brannon's SpeedScript word processor ported
to the Plus/4.  SSP4 is generally the same as the C64
version, but some of the text editing command characters
have been changed.  See the March, 1985, issue of Compute!
Gazette for general information on how the program works.
Information specifically relevant to SSP4 is found in the
HLP file here.

Included here are:

1.  SSP4.PRG - The executable program.  Load and Run.

2.  SSP4.SC1 and .SC2 - The source code for SSP4, which can
    be used with ASMP4 or ASM64 to assemble the program and
    make modifications.

3.  SSP4HLP.ASC, .PET, and.SC - Instructions in Ascii,
    Petscii, and SpeedScript text file format, which
    is actually screen code saved as a PRG file.

4.  This ReadMe file.

Except for the initial SYS command, the entire program is
written in ML.  It will also run on a C16 which has been
expanded to 64K of RAM.
