There is an error in the Plus/4 Kernel code that services an IRQ
interrupt generated by the 6551 (aka 8551) ACIA.

The error is in the 6551 ACIA servicing routine where a byte is read in
from the ACIA:

LDA $FD00
BEQ EAC2
STA $07D5

Incoming bytes are first stored at $07D5, and later moved from there into
the input buffer.  But as the rom is written, any null byte (00) would not
be saved in $07D5, and the most recent non-null byte saved there would be
added again to the input buffer.  No null byte can ever be received, which
would make file transfers impossible.  The solution is to reverse the
second and third instructions when flashing a new Kernel ROM:

LDA $FD00
STA $07D5
BEQ EAC2

Or, you could duplicate the beginning of the IRQ servicing up to this point
in your code, with the correction, then jump back into the ROM.  Included
here is a BASIC program that loads alternate IRQ ACIA code into the cassette
buffer at $0333 (819) and points the IRQ RAM vector at $0314 to $035a (858).
The alternate code is 120 bytes long. After installing the new code, the
BASIC program does not need to be retained in memory.
