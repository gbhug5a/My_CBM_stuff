
This is an article on the 1541/1571/1581 REL file bugs.  It
was submitted to and accepted by Transactor magazine as
"BEYOND RAID" but Transactor shut down before it could be
published. I believe the article pins down exactly what
caused these bugs (yes, there are two of them), tells how to
avoid them, and provides changes to the drives' ROMs that
eliminate them.

Included here are:

1.  The original article text in Ascii.
2.  An addendum explaining the ML routine in the article.
3.  Listing in ASCII of the ML routine called Program 1.
4.  Program2 and Program3 in PRG form.
5.  Ascii listings of Program2 and Program3
6.  This ReadMe file in Ascii.
