
These are some programs, and two magazine articles, I wrote
or adapted back in the late-1980s.  Anyone who wants them,
for any purpose, is welcome to use them.

The programs are written in assembler, and the source code
for the first three is included, so that any desired
modifications can be made.  Each program has an instruction
manual.

Here's the list:

1.  ASM64 - This is a symbolic assembler for the C64
based on Charles Brannon's SpeedScript word processor.
Doesn't use line numbers.

2.  ASMP4 - Essentially the same program for the Plus/4.

3.  SSP4 - The SpeedScript program ported to the Plus/4.

4.  MLMON64 - A machine language monitor program for the C64
which can be installed where you like, and fits into 2K.

5.  Beyond Raid - A magazine article which I believe is the
final word on the REL file bugs - what causes them, how to
avoid them, and drive ROM changes to eliminate them.
Transactor shut down right after accepting the article,
so it was never published.

6.  Toward 2400 - A magazine article published in Volume 9
Number 3 (February 1989) of Transactor magazine.  It provided
alternate software which permitted reliable RS232 communications
for the C64 and C128.

7.  Plus4 IRQ ACIA error - Identifies an error in the Kernel
ROM of the Commodore Plus4 involving the handling of null bytes
received  from the ACIA.  An alternate IRQ service routine is
provided to bypass the error.
